prismaXzod

A tiny-but-powerful package that lets you generate Zod schemas straight from your Prisma models — dynamically, no codegen, no manual TS files, no pain.

Just pass a model name → get a Zod object → vibe.
Perfect for building APIs, validators, form validators, etc., without maintaining extra schema files
